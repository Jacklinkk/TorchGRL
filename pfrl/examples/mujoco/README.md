# Examples for MuJoCo tasks

We currently have example reproducibility scripts for 5 algorithms on Mujoco environments (all in `reproduction`): Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Twin-delayed DDPG (TD3), and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO).
