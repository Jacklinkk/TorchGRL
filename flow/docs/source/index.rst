Welcome to Flow
================

`Flow <https://flow-project.github.io>`_ is a computational framework for deep RL and control experiments for traffic microsimulation. Visit `our website <https://flow-project.github.io>`_ for more information.

Flow is a work in progress - input is welcome. Available documentation is limited for now.
`Tutorials <https://github.com/flow-project/flow/tree/master/tutorials>`_ are available in iPython notebook format.

*If you are looking for Akvo Flow, their documentation can be found at* http://flowsupport.akvo.org.
