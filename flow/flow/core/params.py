    These parameters are used to customize a sumo simulation instance upon
    initialization. This includes passing the simulation step length,
    specifying whether to use sumo's gui during a run, and other features
    described in the Attributes below.

    Attributes
    ----------
    port : int, optional
        Port for Traci to connect to; finds an empty port by default
    sim_step : float optional
        seconds per simulation step; 0.1 by default
    emission_path : str, optional
        Path to the folder in which to create the emissions output.
        Emissions output is not generated if this value is not specified
    lateral_resolution : float, optional
        width of the divided sublanes within a lane, defaults to None (i.e.
        no sublanes). If this value is specified, the vehicle in the
        network cannot use the "LC2013" lane change model.
    no_step_log : bool, optional
        specifies whether to add sumo's step logs to the log file, and
        print them into the terminal during runtime, defaults to True
    render : str or bool, optional
        specifies whether to visualize the rollout(s)

        * False: no rendering
        * True: delegate rendering to sumo-gui for back-compatibility

        * "dgray": dynamic grayscale rendering
        * "rgb": static RGB rendering
        * "drgb": dynamic RGB rendering, which is good for visualization

    save_render : bool, optional

        the left
    seed : int, optional
        seed for sumo instance
    restart_instance : bool, optional
        specifies whether to restart a sumo instance upon reset. Restarting
        the instance helps avoid slowdowns cause by excessive inflows over
        large experiment runtimes, but also require the gui to be started
        after every reset if "render" is set to True.
    print_warnings : bool, optional
        If set to false, this will silence sumo warnings on the stdout
    teleport_time : int, optional
        If negative, vehicles don't teleport in gridlock. If positive,
        they teleport after teleport_time seconds
    num_clients : int, optional
        Number of clients that will connect to Traci
    color_by_speed : bool
        whether to color the vehicles by the speed they are moving at the
        current time step
    use_ballistic: bool, optional
        If true, use a ballistic integration step instead of an euler step

        Parameters
        ----------
        edge : str
            starting edge for the vehicles in this inflow
        veh_type : str
            type of the vehicles entering the edge. Must match one of the types
            set in the Vehicles class
        vehs_per_hour : float, optional
            number of vehicles per hour, equally spaced (in vehicles/hour).
            Cannot be specified together with probability or period
        probability : float, optional
            probability for emitting a vehicle each second (between 0 and 1).
            Cannot be specified together with vehs_per_hour or period
        period : float, optional
            insert equally spaced vehicles at that period (in seconds). Cannot
            be specified together with vehs_per_hour or probability
        depart_lane : int or str
            the lane on which the vehicle shall be inserted. Can be either one
            of:

            * int >= 0: index of the lane (starting with rightmost = 0)
            * "random": a random lane is chosen, but the vehicle insertion is
              not retried if it could not be inserted
            * "free": the most free (least occupied) lane is chosen
            * "best": the "free" lane (see above) among those who allow the
              vehicle the longest ride without the need to change lane
            * "first": the rightmost lane the vehicle may use

            Defaults to "first".
        depart_speed : float or str
            the speed with which the vehicle shall enter the network (in m/s)
            can be either one of:

            - float >= 0: the vehicle is tried to be inserted using the given
              speed; if that speed is unsafe, departure is delayed
            - "random": vehicles enter the edge with a random speed between 0
              and the speed limit on the edge; the entering speed may be
              adapted to ensure a safe distance to the leading vehicle is kept
            - "speedLimit": vehicles enter the edge with the maximum speed that
              is allowed on this edge; if that speed is unsafe, departure is
              delayed

            Defaults to 0.
        name : str, optional
            prefix for the id of the vehicles entering via this inflow.
            Defaults to "flow"
        begin : float, optional
            first vehicle departure time (in seconds, minimum 1 second).
            Defaults to 1 second
        end : float, optional
            end of departure interval (in seconds). This parameter is not taken
            into account if 'number' is specified. Defaults to 24 hours
        number : int, optional
            total number of vehicles the inflow should create (due to rounding
            up, this parameter may not be exactly enforced and shouldn't be set
            too small). Default: infinite (c.f. 'end' parameter)
