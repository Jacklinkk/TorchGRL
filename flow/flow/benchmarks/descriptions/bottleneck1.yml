description: "Maximizing throughput in a bottleneck structure: The goal of this problem is to learn to avoid the capacity drop that is characteristic to bottleneck structures in transportation networks, and maximize the total outflow in a mixed-autonomy setting. <br> 4 lanes, inflow = 1900 veh/hour, 10% CAV penetration, the human drivers follow the standard lane changing model in the simulator, S=(141,), A=(20,), T=1000."
