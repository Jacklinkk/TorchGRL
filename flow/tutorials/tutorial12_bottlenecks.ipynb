    "# Tutorial 12: Bottleneck Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through the process of *running the bottleneck experiments*. The bottleneck experiment, depicted in Fig. 1, is intended to illustrate the dynamics of traffic in a bottleneck. In particular, our bottleneck is intended to imitate the dynamics of traffic on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, where fifteen lanes narrow to eight to five. In our bottleneck, we have N * 4 lanes narrow to N * 2 to N, where N is a scaling factor that can be used to increase the number of lanes. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, this bottleneck has a phenomenon known as *capacity drop*: as the number of vehicles flowing into the system increases the number of exiting vehicles initially increases. However, above a critical flow of entering vehicles, the output of the system starts to decrease as congestion forms. Just like in the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, there is a configurable toll booth and a set of traffic lights that can be used to control the inflow. Each of the merges is implemented as a zipper merge, in which the vehicles merge as late as possible. \n",

If *disable_tb=False*, cars that approach the toll-booth have their color changed to blue to indicate that they are in the toll-booth region. Their lane changing is disabled. As they come to the front of the toll-booth, we sample from a gaussian to determine how long they should be held at the toll booth. The holding process is imitated by a red light that remains red for the duration of the holding time. As indicated in the figure, the outer lanes are fast-trak lanes; their mean holding time is set to be lower than the holding time of the other toll-booth lanes.
